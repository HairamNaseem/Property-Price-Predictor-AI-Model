# Property-Price-Predictor-AI-Model
Property Price Predictor machine learning model

Our project is based on a housing dataset which predicts the price of a house based on some of its attributes.
We start by analyzing the problem from collecting data, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, dealing with missing values, and creating a pipeline.
Some other concepts used in this project are:
Cross validation 
Train-test splitting by determining a normalized ratio between train and test data
Improving accuracy of program by trying different regression techniques such as linear regression, multiple regression and random forest regression.
We have done feature engineering through creating a pipeline and inserting data into pipeline so it can be converted into an array of float to be easier to process
